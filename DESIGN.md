# Screenlit: Artifact-First AI Application Framework

## Concept
Screenlit (Screen + Literature/Light) is a new Python library designed to build AI-driven applications with a focus on "Artifact-First" workflow.

*   **Artifact-First:** Optimized for the process where AI and humans collaborate to create and edit deliverables (artifacts) like reports, code, and documents.
*   **AI-Driven:** Native integration with AI ecosystems.
*   **Modern App:** Single Page Application (SPA) experience with React/TypeScript frontend and Python backend.
*   **AWS Based:** Scalable architecture suitable for AWS deployment.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Python-First DX
*   Eliminate the overhead of learning React/TS for Python engineers.
*   Focus on backend logic and AI orchestration.
*   "Declarative UI" for high-level control, "Object-Oriented" for detailed customization.

### 2. Architecture
*   **Backend:** FastAPI-based persistent server (unlike Streamlit's rerun model).
*   **Communication:** SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time updates from AI to UI. REST API for user actions.
*   **State Management:** State is managed on both sides but synchronized. Python controls the "Truth" of the session state.

### 3. Key Components
*   `sl.layout`: Controls the application layout (Chat, Artifacts, Docs).
*   `sl.artifacts`: Manages the content generated by AI.
*   `sl.events`: Handles user interactions (not fully implemented yet in MVP).

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Screen Control & Artifacts (Current)
*   `sl.layout` API for controlling panels.
*   `sl.artifacts` API for creating/updating content.
*   Basic Chat <-> Python loop.

### Phase 2: Agent Integration
*   LangChain / LangGraph support.
*   "Thinking" process visualization.
*   OpenTelemetry integration.

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features
*   Authentication (Cognito/Auth0).
*   Session management.
*   RBAC.

### Phase 4: Deployment
*   Docker containerization.
*   CLI tools (`screenlit run`).

## Progress (MVP)
*   Established Frontend-Backend connection via SSE.
*   Implemented `sl.layout` for mode switching (Standard, Chat Only, Split).
*   Implemented `sl.artifacts` for content generation.
*   Refactored Frontend to use global stores (Zustand) for better state management.
